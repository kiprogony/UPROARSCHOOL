                  <h2>History of Uproar Academy</h2>
                  <p>Uproar school begun in January 2001. Construction of the Junior School begun in 20001. From it's inception in 2001, the school has sought to be the best academically and professionally. This endeavor has helped us emerge the best Nationally on a regular basis.For over nineteen years (19+) Uproar school has been dedicated to the excellent performance and the mentor-ship of Kenyaâ€™s future leaders. Our core values are guided by the principle: Knowledge is Power On that foundation, we nurture our children into disciplined, upstanding future decision-makers. To nurture talent and curiosity at this age is consequently monumental. At Uproar, we recognize the need to encourage such ventures.Our children have every convenience at their disposal, should their interest lie in Science, Research, Technology, Sports or Drama. Our children come in as young as three (3) years into the Play School (PP1) and go up to Class Eight (8). Our Academic performance over the years has seen us consistently ranked among the top schools in Kenya. 100% of Uproar Students get accepted into National and Provincial High Schools.</p>
